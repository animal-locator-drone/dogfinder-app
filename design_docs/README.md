## Excalidraw Wireframes

1. We are using excalidraw to create a simple wireframe of the app 
2. The files are stored and versioned here as .excalidraw files
3. For small changes you can just update the latest file (they are prepended with a date stamp)
4. For major changes make a new file with the date prepended as YYYYMMDD
  1. This way we know whats the latest file to work on and also are able to revert to older versions.
